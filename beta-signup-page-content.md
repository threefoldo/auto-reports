### Problem Section

**Section Header**:
```
You're Not Alone in This Struggle
```

**Body Copy**:
```
In research analyzing 500+ PhD student experiences, we found:

📊 38% struggle to get any feedback at all from their advisor
📊 24% receive feedback too vague to act on
📊 19% get inconsistent or contradictory feedback
📊 14% wait 4-6 weeks (or longer) for responses
📊 12% receive feedback that's demotivating rather than constructive

The median turnaround time for dissertation feedback? 4-6 weeks.

That's not a personal failing. That's a systemic problem.
```

**Pain Point Callouts** (3 columns):

**Column 1: "No Feedback"**
```
"I sent my chapter 8 weeks ago. Still nothing."

Sound familiar? You're one of thousands experiencing this.
```

**Column 2: "Vague Feedback"**
```
"'This needs work' - but what specifically needs work?"

Vague comments leave you stuck, not knowing what to fix.
```

**Column 3: "Slow Turnaround"**
```
"Every 6-week wait kills my momentum and confidence."

Slow feedback doesn't just delay graduation - it affects your mental health.
```

### FAQ Section (Accordion)

**Q: What stage do I need to be at?**
```
A: Any stage of dissertation writing. Whether you're working on your proposal
or final chapters, if you need feedback, this can help.
```

**Q: Will this replace my advisor?**
```
A: No. PhD-Assist helps you get your work into better shape before sending to
your advisor, making their feedback more productive. It's a supplement, not a
replacement.
```

**Q: Is this allowed/ethical?**
```
A: Yes. This is like getting feedback from a writing center or peer review
group - it helps you improve your work, but you're still doing the writing and
thinking. We help you identify issues, you fix them.
```

**Q: How is this different from AI writing tools?**
```
A: PhD-Assist doesn't write for you. It provides structured feedback using
rubrics based on actual dissertation standards, helping you identify what needs
improvement. The writing is still 100% yours.
```

**Q: What if I don't like it during the beta?**
```
A: No problem! Beta is completely free and you can stop using it anytime. We
just ask for honest feedback about what didn't work for you.
```

**Q: How much will it cost after beta?**
```
A: Still determining pricing based on beta feedback. Beta participants get
50% lifetime discount regardless. Current range: $20-40/month or $200-400/year
(but beta testers would pay half that).
```

**Q: When does beta start?**
```
A: [Specific month]. We'll email you 1 week before to prepare.

### Problem Section (Storytelling Approach)

**Section Header**:
```
If This Sounds Familiar, You're in the Right Place
```

**Scenario 1**:
```
📧 You sent your chapter to your advisor 6 weeks ago.

You check your email compulsively. Nothing.

You send a "just checking in" email. No response.

You start to panic. Is it so bad they don't know what to say? Did they forget?
Should you email again or wait?

Your momentum is dead. Your confidence is gone. You're stuck.
```

**Scenario 2**:
```
📝 Finally, feedback arrives. You open it eagerly.

"This needs work."
"Develop this section more."
"Not quite there yet."

You read it three times. You still have no idea what to actually fix.

You revise based on your best guess. Send it back. Wait another month.

"Better, but still needs work."

The cycle continues. Graduation feels impossibly far away.
```

**Scenario 3**:
```
💬 You finally get a meeting with your advisor.

They give you detailed feedback. You take notes frantically. You feel clear
on next steps.

Three months later, you submit revisions.

"Actually, on second thought, I think you should go in a different direction."

All that work. Wasted. You want to cry.
```

**Empathy Statement**:
```
This isn't just frustrating. It's demoralizing.

It makes you question your work, your advisor, your decision to do a PhD at all.

You're not being dramatic. This is genuinely hard.

And it's not your fault.
```

---

### Solution Section

**Section Header**:
```
Imagine Getting Feedback That Actually Helps
```

**Body Copy**:
```
Specific feedback that tells you exactly what to improve.

Fast turnaround so you maintain momentum.

Structured guidance so you know you're addressing the right issues.

Confidence that your next submission to your advisor will be stronger.

That's what PhD-Assist is built to provide.
```

**Benefits** (icon + text):

**🎯 Specific, Not Vague**
```
No more "needs work" without knowing what needs work. Get detailed, actionable
feedback on exactly what to improve.
```

**⚡ Days, Not Months**
```
Get feedback in days, not weeks or months. Keep your momentum instead of losing
it during long waiting periods.
```

**📋 Structured & Complete**
```
Based on actual dissertation rubrics. Know you're addressing what actually
matters to committees, not just guessing.
```

**💪 Build Confidence**
```
Submit to your advisor knowing you've already addressed major issues. Reduce
revision rounds and anxiety.
```

### Personal Story

**Section Header**:
```
Why I Built This
```

**Body Copy**:
```
I'm a PhD student. I've lived this frustration.

After my third round of revisions on a chapter my advisor kept saying "needed
more development" (without saying what to develop), I started researching how
other students handled feedback challenges.

I analyzed 500+ experiences across Reddit, academic forums, and surveys.

What I found shocked me:

This isn't a "you" problem. It's not even an "your advisor" problem.
It's a systemic problem affecting most PhD students.

But some students had found solutions that worked.

I compiled what actually helps, talked to dozens of PhD students about what
they wish existed, and built PhD-Assist.

This is the tool I wish I had in year 1.

Now I'm inviting 30 PhD students to help make it better.

## Email Sequence for Waitlist

### Email 1: Immediate (Confirmation - see above)

### Email 2: +3 Days - Share Research

**Subject**: The #1 dissertation feedback complaint (from 500+ PhD students)

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Quick update from the PhD-Assist beta waitlist.

I've been analyzing dissertation feedback complaints across Reddit, surveys, and
forums to build PhD-Assist on evidence, not assumptions.

The research is fascinating. Here's what I found:

**The Top 6 Feedback Pain Points:**

1. **No feedback** (38%) - "My advisor hasn't responded in 2 months"
2. **Vague feedback** (24%) - "'Needs work' - but what needs work??"
3. **Inconsistent** (19%) - "They keep contradicting themselves"
4. **Slow turnaround** (17%) - "6+ weeks every single time"
5. **Harsh/demotivating** (12%) - "Criticism without constructive guidance"
6. **Unavailable advisor** (14%) - "Too busy to meet or review"

[You selected "[their selected pain point]" in your signup - here's what the
research shows about that specific issue: [personalized paragraph]]

**What Actually Helps:**

I also compiled what students say actually works. I'll share more in next week's
email, but the short version: structured approaches work better than hoping your
advisor changes.

That's what PhD-Assist is built around.

Beta launches in [X weeks]. I'll keep you posted.

Questions or thoughts? Just reply.

Best,

### Email 3: +10 Days - Solution Preview

**Subject**: Here's how PhD-Assist actually works

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Last week I shared the research on feedback pain points. This week: how PhD-Assist
actually helps.

**The Core Idea:**

Most dissertation feedback problems come down to:
1. Advisors are overwhelmed (limited time, many students)
2. Students don't know what "good" looks like (no clear standards)
3. Feedback is unstructured (no rubrics or frameworks)

PhD-Assist addresses all three:

**1. Structured Feedback Framework**
- Based on validated dissertation rubrics
- Clear criteria (methodology, argumentation, structure, etc.)
- Same standards committees use to evaluate work

**2. Fast Turnaround**
- Get feedback in days, not weeks
- Keep momentum during advisor gaps
- Iterate quickly

**3. Specific, Actionable Comments**
- Not "needs work" - tells you exactly what to improve
- Prioritizes issues (major vs. minor)
- Gives revision suggestions

**Real Example** (from pilot testing):

Before PhD-Assist:
"Your literature review needs more development." (Vague - what development?)

With PhD-Assist:
"Literature review strengths: Good coverage of theoretical frameworks.
Gaps identified:
1. Missing synthesis - theories are described but not compared/contrasted
2. Research gap not clearly stated (appears implied on p.12 but needs explicit
   statement)
3. Limited engagement with methodological debates in the field
Suggestion: Add 2-3 paragraphs synthesizing theories + 1 paragraph explicitly
stating gap your research fills."

See the difference?

### Email 4: +20 Days - Beta Preparation

**Subject**: PhD-Assist beta launches in 2 weeks - here's what to expect

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Quick heads up: Beta launches in 2 weeks (week of [date]).

**What to expect:**

📧 **Week of [date]**: You'll get beta access email with login instructions

📝 **First task**: Upload a section you need feedback on (doesn't have to be
perfect - this is beta testing!)

⏱️ **Within 48-72 hours**: You'll receive structured feedback

🔄 **Over 6 months**: Use as much or as little as helpful for your work

📞 **2-3 weeks in**: I'll reach out to schedule a short feedback call (30 min)
to hear what's working and what's not

**No pressure to use it constantly** - use it when you need feedback. The goal
is to help you, not create another obligation.

**If you can't participate anymore**, just reply and let me know. No hard feelings!
I'd rather have engaged beta testers than a long list.

---

**Quick question:**

What's the single most important feature for you? (Reply with one sentence)

This helps me prioritize what to focus on first in beta.

---

See you in 2 weeks!

[Your Name]
```

### Email 5: Launch Day

**Subject**: 🚀 PhD-Assist Beta is Live - Your Login Info

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

It's here! PhD-Assist beta is officially live.

**Your Login:**
Email: [their email]
Password: [temporary password]
Link: [login link]

**Getting Started (5 minutes):**

1. Log in and change your password
2. Upload a section you need feedback on (chapter, proposal section, lit review, etc.)
3. Select focus areas (methodology, argumentation, structure, etc.)
4. Submit

You'll get feedback within 48-72 hours (I'm doing some manual review during beta
to ensure quality).

**What to Focus On**:

This is beta, so it won't be perfect. What I need from you:
• Does the feedback help you revise?
• Is it specific enough?
• Is it addressing the right issues?
• What's missing?

Don't worry about being nice - honest, critical feedback makes this better.

**Questions?**

Reply to this email or use the feedback button in the tool. I'm monitoring both.

Excited to hear what you think!

P.S. - Reminder: This is free for 6 months. You'll get 50% lifetime discount when
we launch publicly, but you'll never be charged without explicit opt-in.

## Final Notes

**Remember**:
- Clear > Clever (straightforward copy converts better)
- Benefits > Features (they care about outcomes, not functions)
- Specific > Vague (concrete examples build trust)
- Simple > Complex (fewer fields = higher conversions)

**Most Important**:
Your landing page should answer three questions immediately:
1. What is this?
2. How does it help me?
3. What do I need to do?

If a PhD student lands on your page and can't answer all three in 10 seconds,
simplify.

Good luck! 🚀
