Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of Survey Data with Post-stratification

September 23, 2025

ByThomas Wiecki

Introduction

In this panel discussion, Tarmo Jüristo tells us how Bayesian modeling can help in environments where data are noisy and uncertainty is high –like public opinion polls. In particular, data can be sparse in some strata of the population, making the model’s job harder, precisely for the demographics you’re the most interested in.
A special focus is placed on the work PyMC Labs has done with Tarmo, implementing a state-of-the-art hierarchical Bayesian model. Coupled with post-stratification, this method not only makes inference possible – it makes it actionable, even you have only a few data points for some demographics.

16:27Further refinements of the Multilevel regression with post-stratification

19:57Model output

25:50Question: On a multilevel aspect, does this mean you model other clusters/groups within other clusters/groups?

28:43Input to simulation

32:20Final simulation

34:46Alex Andorra introduces himself

36:40Question: How do you choose whether it makes sense to add interactions to a model and do you start with all possible interactions?

38:56Technical difficulties during the project

46:59Demonstration of the dashboard

51:52You can use geospatial covariation to extend the model

53:27Does the forecasting take the difference in policies between parties

54:19Using Gaussian Processes in the model(Advantages and disadvantages)

59:55Question: If you have more time, what would you add to the model

1:02:56Question: How well do you think the model is taking without rare events?
