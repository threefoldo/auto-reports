Bayesian Methods in Modern Marketing Analytics

September 23, 2025

ByThomas Wiecki

Introduction

Bayesian methods have gained significant popularity in modern marketing analytics due to their ability to handle uncertainty, incorporate prior knowledge, and make accurate predictions. Unlike traditional statistical approaches, Bayesian methods provide a flexible framework that enables marketers to make data-driven decisions by combining observed data with prior beliefs or assumptions.

Event Description

In this webinar we discuss some of the most crucial topics in marketing analytics: media spend optimization through media mix models and experimentation, and customer lifetime value estimation. We approach these topics from a Bayesian perspective, as it gives us great tools to have better models and more actionable insights. We take this opportunity to describe our join with PyMC Labs in open-sourcing some of these tools in our brand-new pymc-marketing Python packagePyMC Marketing.
