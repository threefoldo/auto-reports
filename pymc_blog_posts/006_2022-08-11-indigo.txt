Bayesian Modeling in Biotech: Using PyMC to Analyze Agricultural Data

September 23, 2025

ByThomas Wiecki

Introduction

In July 2022, we organized a panel discussion with Manu Martinet ofIndigo Agand Thomas Wiecki and Bill Engels of PyMC Labs to discuss a case-study of measuring effects of crop-types in an agricultural setting.  The goal of the project was to identify the underlying spatial pattern and remove it in order to measure more accurately the treatment effect, which in this case are microbes which contribute to plant yield.

PyMC Labs were consultants on this project which had limited data and which used Bayesian analyses and Gaussian processes to identify the treatment effect.  We demonstrate how Bayesian modeling is a powerful tool for solving problems in biotechnology.
