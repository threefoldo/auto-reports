# Pain Point #2: Vague, Non-Actionable Feedback

## Overview

**The Problem**: Feedback that identifies problems but doesn't explain how to fix them, or provides cryptic comments without clear guidance on improvement.

**Severity**: **HIGH** - Mental health and productivity consequences

**Prevalence**: Extremely common - one of the most frequent complaints in academic writing forums

**Core Issue**: Students receive comments like "this needs work" or "unclear" without any explanation of what specifically is wrong or how to improve.

## The Problem in Detail

### What Vague Feedback Looks Like

#### Common Vague Comments

| ❌ Vague (Unhelpful) | What's Wrong With It |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| "This is such a great paper" | Doesn't identify specific strengths |
| "This needs work" | No indication of what or how |
| "Unclear" | Doesn't say what's unclear or why |
| "Strengthen this" | No guidance on how to strengthen |
| "Not convincing" | Doesn't explain why not |
| "This doesn't work for me" | Personal reaction, not actionable critique |
| "Your argument is weak" | Doesn't explain the weakness |
| "The ending was weak" | Too general to act upon |
| "I got lost" | Doesn't say where or why |
| "This example didn't work for me" | No explanation of the problem |
| "Good job!" | Generic praise without specifics |

### Real User Stories

#### **Design Research PhD Student (Year 1)**

**The Situation**:
> "During our monthly meetings, my supervisor offers no advice or guidance about how to develop research ideas into research questions. When I ask directly 'what topic do you think has the most value?' they respond with 'what topic do YOU think has the most value?'"

**The Impact**:
> "I'm nearing the end of year one without clear direction on my dissertation topic."

**The Frustration**:
> Multiple respondents confirmed this is a common experience - the "pursue your own path" advising style that devolves into neglect rather than mentorship.

**Source**: Academia Stack Exchange - "I get no advice or guidance from my supervisor"

#### **Supervisor Useless Complaints**

Students report supervisors who:
- **"Only gives me feedback on grammar and expression"** without addressing research quality
- Offer **vague comments** without explaining how to improve or meet unstated standards
- Provide **cryptic remarks** that students can't interpret
- **Lack constructive guidance** - feedback identifies problems but fails to suggest solutions

**The Root Problem**:
> "Inadequate feedback prevents students from understanding whether their actual research design and methodology meet program standards versus merely correcting writing mechanics."

**Source**: "Is it just me, or is my dissertation supervisor useless?" - Read Write Perfect

### What Students Actually Need (But Don't Get)

Students need feedback on:
> "Whether my research design and methodology meet program standards, not just corrections on writing mechanics."

But instead they get:
- Comments only on grammar
- Vague criticisms without explanations
- No guidance on how to develop ideas
- Personal reactions ("this doesn't work for me") without explanations

## Impact & Consequences

### Academic Impact

**Students who receive vague feedback**:
- ✗ **Experience meltdowns** from confusion and frustration
- ✗ **Spend months confused** about what to do
- ✗ **Get overwhelmed and stop** working entirely
- ✗ **Spiral into self-doubt** questioning their abilities
- ✗ **Waste time** on revisions that don't address the real issues

### Emotional & Mental Health Impact

**Research Finding**:
> "Students can experience meltdowns, spend months in confusion, get overwhelmed and stop, or spiral into self-doubt."

**The Emotional Toll**:
- **Anxiety**: Not knowing if you're on the right track
- **Frustration**: Working hard but can't figure out what to change
- **Self-doubt**: "Am I just not smart enough to understand?"
- **Helplessness**: "I don't know what to do with this feedback"
- **Isolation**: "I must be the only one who doesn't get it"

### Productivity Impact

**Time Wasted**:
- Multiple revision cycles that don't improve the work
- Guessing what advisor wants
- Trying random changes hoping something sticks
- Seeking clarification (if advisor responds)

**Work Quality Suffers**:
- Can't improve what you don't understand
- May overcorrect or undercorrect
- Miss the actual issues that need addressing
- Focus on wrong aspects of the work

## What Good Feedback Looks Like

### The Golden Rule of Specificity

**Research Finding**:
> "The most useful feedback is almost always feedback that is specific. Specific feedback gives you something to go on - you know what's at issue and can either reject it or deal with it."

**Best Practice**:
> "Rather than vague comments like 'this needs work,' detailed feedback tells the writer what you were hoping to read, what you were expecting them to have done, providing them with something to look at and something that they can change."

### Examples of Specific vs. Vague Feedback

| ❌ Vague (Unhelpful) | ✅ Specific (Helpful) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "This is such a great paper" | "The anecdote you used at the start was a really effective way to communicate the context" |
| "I really didn't quite get what you were trying to say" | "I got lost because the headings didn't help me track the argument" |
| "Your argument doesn't work for me" | "Your argument doesn't work because you haven't yet taken counter views into account" |
| "The ending of the paper was weak" | "The ending needed a discussion of study implications" |
| "This example didn't work for me" | "This example confuses the timeline - consider using the Johnson (2015) case instead" |
| "This needs work" | "Your methods section needs more detail about how you selected participants - include your sampling criteria and justification" |
| "Unclear" | "This sentence is unclear - are you arguing that X causes Y, or that they're correlated?" |
| "Strengthen this claim" | "This claim needs support - add 2-3 empirical examples from your data" |
| "This section is too long" | "This section is 15 pages but only makes one point - cut paragraphs 3-7 or develop them into separate arguments" |

### The Three-Part Formula for Specific Feedback

Good feedback should tell the writer:

1. **WHAT** needs changing (specific location, issue)
2. **WHY** it's problematic (explanation)
3. **HOW** to improve it (actionable guidance or options)

#### Example Using the Formula:

**WHAT**: "Your sampling method description (lines 89-95)"

**WHY**: "is unclear because you don't explain why you chose purposive sampling over random sampling"

**HOW**: "Add 2-3 sentences explaining the rationale. Consider: What characteristics did you need participants to have? Why was targeted selection more appropriate than random selection for your research questions?"

**Complete Feedback**:
> "Your sampling method description (lines 89-95) is unclear because you don't explain why you chose purposive sampling over random sampling. Add 2-3 sentences explaining the rationale. Consider: What characteristics did you need participants to have? Why was targeted selection more appropriate than random selection for your research questions?"

### Characteristics of Actionable Feedback

**Research Findings**:

> "The best way to identify constructive feedback is to look for actionable points - if supervisors only comment on quality without making suggestions for changes, that's not constructive criticism."

> "Feedback is most effective when it is timely, perceived as relevant, meaningful and encouraging, and offers suggestions for improvement that are within a student's understanding."

**Actionable Feedback Must Be**:
- ✅ **Specific**: Identifies exact issues
- ✅ **Clear**: Unambiguous language
- ✅ **Directive**: Provides clear guidance
- ✅ **Feasible**: Within student's capacity to address
- ✅ **Prioritized**: Indicates what matters most

### Good Marginal Comments Examples

**On Evidence**:
> "Your evidence in this paragraph is effective -- it convinces me to believe your claims."

**On Clarity**:
> "This sentence is unclear - are you arguing that X causes Y, or that they're correlated?"

**On Logic**:
> "This conclusion doesn't follow from your evidence. You've shown X and Y, but you're claiming Z. Can you add the missing link?"

**On Structure**:
> "Consider moving this paragraph earlier - it provides context needed to understand the argument that follows."

**On Literature**:
> "Have you looked at Johnson (2020)? Her work on X directly relates to your argument here."

**On Methods**:
> "Why did you choose this sampling method? Add 2-3 sentences justifying this choice over alternatives."

## Practical Solutions

### For Students: How to Request Specific Feedback

#### Strategy #1: Be Directive About What You Need

**Research Finding**:
> "Students should be directive about what kind of feedback they need, suggesting supervisors focus on specific aspects like text coherence, whether it addresses research questions, or whether they've read the right sources."

**Instead of**: "Please review this chapter"

**Try**: "Please focus on whether my methodology is sound and whether I've justified my sampling approach adequately"

#### Specific Request Templates

**For Methodology Chapter**:
> "Professor, I'm submitting my methodology chapter. I would particularly appreciate feedback on:
> 1. Whether my research design aligns with my research questions
> 2. If my sampling approach is justified adequately
> 3. Whether my data analysis plan is appropriate for my data type
>
> I've already had the writing center review for clarity and organization."

**For Literature Review**:
> "I'm seeking feedback on my literature review, specifically:
> 1. Have I identified the key debates in the field adequately?
> 2. Is my 'gap in the literature' argument convincing?
> 3. Are there major sources I'm missing?
>
> I'm less concerned about writing style at this stage."

**For Results Chapter**:
> "Please focus on:
> 1. Does my presentation of results address my research questions?
> 2. Is the organization clear and logical?
> 3. Am I over-interpreting or under-interpreting my data?"

#### Strategy #2: Use Guiding Questions

Provide questions to structure feedback:
- "Does my argument hold together logically?"
- "Are my research questions clearly defined?"
- "Have I addressed the counterarguments adequately?"
- "Is the organization effective or confusing?"
- "Where did you get lost or confused?"

#### Strategy #3: Request Examples

When you get vague feedback:

**Vague**: "This argument is weak"

**Your Response**: "Thank you for the feedback. Could you help me understand specifically what makes the argument weak? For example, is it:
- Insufficient evidence?
- Logical gaps?
- Missing counterarguments?
- Unclear reasoning?

An example of what would strengthen it would be very helpful."

#### Strategy #4: Follow-Up Meeting

**Email after receiving vague written feedback**:
> "Thank you for your comments on Chapter 3. I want to make sure I understand your feedback correctly. Could we schedule a 30-minute meeting to discuss your suggestions? I'd like to clarify a few points to ensure my revisions address your concerns."

**In the meeting**, ask:
- "When you said [vague comment], did you mean [specific interpretation]?"
- "Can you give me an example of what you're looking for?"
- "Could you point to a section that does this well so I can model it?"

### For Students: Using Rubrics to Self-Assess

#### Create Your Own Checklist

Instead of waiting for vague feedback, use rubrics to evaluate your own work:

**Methodology Chapter Checklist**:
- [ ] Research design clearly described
- [ ] Alignment with research questions explained
- [ ] Sampling approach justified
- [ ] Data collection procedures detailed
- [ ] Data analysis methods specified
- [ ] Ethical considerations addressed
- [ ] Limitations acknowledged
- [ ] Rigor/trustworthiness discussed

**Then submit with note**:
> "I've used the attached checklist to self-evaluate. I'm particularly uncertain about [specific area]. I would appreciate your specific feedback on this aspect."

#### Use Institutional Rubrics

**Available Resources**:
- University of Wisconsin-Madison: Rubric for Evaluating PhD Dissertation
- Syracuse University: Final Dissertation Rubric (4-point scale)
- Wageningen University: Thesis Evaluation Form

**How to Use**:
1. Download rubric
2. Evaluate your own chapter
3. Identify areas you're uncertain about
4. Request specific feedback on those areas

## Teaching Advisors to Give Specific Feedback

### If You're an Advisor Reading This

#### **The Impact of Vague Feedback**

**Research shows** vague feedback:
- Results in student misinterpretation
- Lacks clarity, preventing improvement
- Causes student meltdowns and self-doubt
- Wastes everyone's time (multiple revision cycles)

#### **How to Transform Vague Comments into Specific Ones**

**Before you write**: Ask yourself:
1. Can the student act on this comment?
2. Do they know WHAT to change?
3. Do they know WHY it's a problem?
4. Do they know HOW to improve it?

If the answer to any is "no," revise your comment.

#### **Comment Banks for Consistency**

**Notre Dame Recommendation**:
> "Keep a comment bank of feedback addressing common mechanical mistakes; rather than re-writing the same comment on every paper, you can note the first instance with an explanatory comment that applies across students."

**Example Comment Bank**:

**Sampling Issues**:
> "Your sampling approach needs more justification. Why did you choose [method] over [alternative]? Add 2-3 sentences explaining: (1) what characteristics you needed in participants, (2) why this sampling method was most appropriate for your RQs, and (3) what limitations this creates."

**Literature Gap Issues**:
> "Your 'gap in literature' argument is too broad. The gap isn't just that 'no one has studied X,' but that no one has studied X in [specific context] using [specific lens/method]. Sharpen this to show why your specific contribution is needed."

**Weak Evidence**:
> "This claim needs empirical support. Provide 2-3 specific examples from your data or cite recent studies (within 5 years). Without evidence, this reads as assertion rather than argument."

Save these, reference them, use them consistently.
