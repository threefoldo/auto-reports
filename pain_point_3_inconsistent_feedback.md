# Pain Point #3: Inconsistent/Contradictory Feedback

## Overview

**The Problem**: Advisors provide feedback that contradicts itself, changes from one draft to the next, or shows they haven't carefully read the work.

**Severity**: **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Time waste, confusion, and inability to know which direction to take

**Prevalence**: Common enough to have multiple discussion threads dedicated to it

**Core Issue**: Students don't know which advice to follow, waste time implementing feedback that gets reversed, and lose confidence in the review process.

---

## The Problem in Detail

### What Inconsistent Feedback Looks Like

#### Types of Inconsistency

**1. Self-Contradictory Comments**
- Says X on page 10, says not-X on page 50
- Criticizes approach in one chapter, praises same approach in another
- Contradicts previous feedback on earlier draft

**2. Evidence of Not Reading Carefully**
- Comments on content that isn't there
- Misremembers what student wrote
- Confuses this dissertation with another student's work

**3. Changing Standards/Expectations**
- Approves approach in proposal, rejects it in dissertation
- Asks for changes, then asks to change back
- "Moving the goalposts" - requirements keep shifting

**4. Contradicts Own Expertise/Previous Advice**
- Feedback contradicts what they taught in class
- Conflicts with previous conversations
- Forgets earlier guidance they provided

### Real User Stories

#### **PhD Student - Inconsistent Feedback on Dissertation**

**Specific Examples**:

**Example 1 - Misread Scope**:
> "My advisor criticized that 'one-hundred pages should not be spent on a particular topic' when that subject only occupied the first thirty pages."

**Impact**: Student questioned whether advisor actually read the work

**Example 2 - Ignored Prior Context**:
> "He expressed concern about the overall trajectory of the project, demonstrating that he either didn't read or doesn't remember my fellowship applications, previous writing, or our conversations."

**Example 3 - Contradicted Praise**:
> "He criticized aspects of my research that have been universally praised by my fellowship mentors."

**The Retraction**:
> "Most troubling was when questioned, he retracted much of his criticism."

This suggests the feedback was performative rather than substantive.

**The Student's Dilemma**:
> "Every PhD guide tells students to do whatever their advisor wants in order to graduate. I'm happy to oblige, but what do you do if your advisor's comments make no sense?"

**Source**: Academia Stack Exchange

#### **Common Patterns Reported**

**Advisors who**:
- Keep changing their mind about what they want
- Don't read or remember previous work
- Contradict praise from other committee members
- Ask for extensive changes then retract when questioned
- Show they confused this student's work with someone else's

---

## Impact & Consequences

### Time Wasted

**Students spend time**:
- Implementing feedback that gets reversed
- Trying to reconcile contradictions
- Re-doing work multiple times
- Seeking clarification (if advisor responds)
- Deciding which contradictory advice to follow

**Example Timeline of Wasted Effort**:
- Week 1-2: Revise based on feedback
- Week 3: Submit revision
- Week 7: Get new feedback contradicting previous round
- Week 8-9: Revise BACK to something closer to original
- Week 10: Submit, repeat cycle

**Result**: 10 weeks to get back to where you started

### Confusion & Inability to Progress

**Students don't know**:
- Which advice to follow when it contradicts
- Whether to trust the feedback at all
- How to satisfy requirements if they keep changing
- Whether the problem is them or the advisor

**The Paralysis**:
> "I'm utterly confused about how to proceed when my advisor's comments make no sense."

### Loss of Trust

**Impact on Advisor-Student Relationship**:
- Student loses confidence in advisor's engagement
- Questions whether advisor is reading carefully
- Wonders if advisor has expertise they claimed
- Becomes defensive or adversarial
- Stops seeking feedback altogether (risky!)

### Risk of Bad Decisions

**Students might**:
- Follow wrong advice (the contradictory version)
- Waste time reconciling irreconcilable feedback
- Make defensive choices that don't improve work
- Abandon good ideas because advisor forgot praising them
- Graduate with weaker work because of inconsistent guidance

## What Good Feedback Looks Like

### Consistency Standards

#### **Internal Consistency Within a Document**

Good feedback should:
- ✅ **Align throughout**: If you say "use more X" on p. 10, don't say "too much X" on p. 50
- ✅ **Be coherent**: Comments should form a unified picture of what needs improvement
- ✅ **Remember earlier comments**: Later feedback should build on earlier points
- ✅ **Track previous drafts**: Acknowledge what was revised successfully

#### **Consistency Across Time**

Good feedback should:
- ✅ **Build on previous rounds**: Acknowledge revisions made
- ✅ **Maintain standards**: Don't change core expectations mid-stream
- ✅ **Explain changes**: If your thinking evolved, say so explicitly
- ✅ **Honor previous agreements**: If you approved approach in proposal, don't reject it in dissertation without very good reason

#### **Consistency Across Committee**

When feedback conflicts between committee members:
- ✅ **Acknowledge disagreement**: "Prof. X suggested Y, but I think Z"
- ✅ **Provide reasoning**: Explain why you disagree with colleague
- ✅ **Offer student guidance**: Help student navigate conflicting advice
- ✅ **Committee discusses**: Major contradictions should be resolved in committee meeting

### Evidence of Careful Reading

**Good feedback shows the advisor**:
- ✅ **Read the whole document**: Comments reference earlier and later sections appropriately
- ✅ **Remembers context**: Acknowledges previous conversations, proposals, earlier drafts
- ✅ **Understands the argument**: Comments show engagement with actual content
- ✅ **Distinguishes this student's work**: Doesn't confuse with other students

**Red Flags of Careless Reading**:
- ❌ Comments on things not in the document
- ❌ Criticizes length of sections inaccurately
- ❌ Forgets major elements of research design
- ❌ Contradicts earlier praise without explanation
- ❌ Suggests student do things they already did

### How to Handle Evolving Thinking

**If your feedback will differ from previous rounds**:

✅ **Good approach**:
> "I know in my last round of feedback I suggested organizing by theme. After reading this revision, I think chronological organization would actually work better for your argument. Here's why my thinking has changed: [explanation]. I apologize for the change in direction, but I think this will strengthen the final product."

❌ **Bad approach**:
> "Organize this chronologically" (when you previously said "organize by theme" with no acknowledgment)

### Documentation & Note-Taking

**Advisors should**:
- Keep notes on what they've suggested
- Review previous feedback before giving new feedback
- Maintain file for each student
- Check proposal/earlier work before commenting

**Research Finding**:
> "The ephemeral nature of verbal feedback dialogues contrasts with concrete textual comments."

**Implication**: Written feedback creates record and reduces inconsistency

## Practical Solutions

### For Students: Dealing with Inconsistent Feedback

#### Strategy #1: Document Everything

**Create a Feedback Log**:

```
FEEDBACK TRACKING LOG

Chapter: _______
Draft Version: _______
Date Submitted: _______

FEEDBACK RECEIVED:

Reviewer: Advisor
Date: _______
Key Points:
1.
2.
3.

Actions Taken:
1.
2.
3.

Date Resubmitted: _______

NEXT ROUND FEEDBACK:

Date: _______
Key Points:
1.
2.
3.

INCONSISTENCIES NOTED:
- Previous feedback said: _______
- Current feedback says: _______
- CONFLICT: _______
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear record of what was said when
- Evidence if you need to escalate
- Helps you identify patterns
- Protects you from "I never said that"

#### Strategy #2: Create Revision Memo

When submitting revisions, include a memo:

```
REVISION MEMO

Chapter: 3 (Methodology)
Previous submission: September 15
Current submission: October 20

REVISIONS MADE:

1. Expanded sampling justification (p. 15-17)
   - In response to your comment: "Need more detail on why purposive sampling"
   - Added 3 paragraphs explaining rationale

2. Reorganized by theme instead of chronology (throughout)
   - In response to your comment: "Thematic organization would be stronger"
   - Moved sections as indicated

3. Added discussion of limitations (p. 45-47)
   - In response to your comment: "Need explicit limitations section"
   - Created new subsection

OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS:

1. You suggested both expanding the intro AND cutting 10 pages overall.
   I've expanded the intro as requested. Should I cut elsewhere to meet
   the overall page target? If so, which section?

Please let me know if these revisions address your concerns or if
further changes are needed.
```

**Benefits**:
- Shows you took feedback seriously
- Documents what you changed
- Flags contradictions politely
- Reduces chance of feedback that ignores revisions

#### Strategy #3: Seek Clarification (Diplomatically)

When you notice contradictions:

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: Clarification on Chapter 3 Feedback

Dear Professor [Name],

Thank you for your feedback on Chapter 3. I want to make sure I
understand correctly, as I noticed what might be a contradiction:

In your feedback on the September draft, you wrote: "Organize by theme
rather than chronologically."

In your recent feedback on the October revision (which I reorganized
by theme), you wrote: "This organization doesn't work - try chronological."

Could you help me understand which approach you'd prefer? Or perhaps
there's a hybrid approach that would work better?

I want to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

Thank you,
[Your name]
```

**Tone**: Curious, not accusatory. "Help me understand" not "you contradicted yourself."

#### Strategy #4: Request Committee Meeting

When contradictions are serious:

**Request**:
> "I'm receiving some conflicting guidance from my committee members. Professor A suggested [X], but Professor B suggested [Y]. Could we schedule a brief committee meeting to discuss the best path forward?"

**Benefits**:
- Gets everyone on same page
- Forces advisor to commit publicly
- Other committee members may notice issues
- Creates witnesses to agreements

#### Strategy #5: Choose and Justify

When contradictions can't be resolved:

**Make a decision** based on:
- Your research goals
- Your disciplinary norms
- Literature in your field
- Committee member with most expertise in that area

**Document your reasoning**:
> "You suggested both [X] and [Y], which seem to pull in different directions. After considering both, I've chosen [X] because [research-based reasoning]. I'm happy to discuss if you'd prefer [Y] instead."

**Benefits**:
- Shows intellectual independence
- Demonstrates reasoning
- Gives advisor easy out ("yes, X makes sense")
- Protects you from blame

### For Students: Using External Reviewers for Consistency Check

#### **Professional Services as "Second Opinion"**

**GradCoach** or **Dissertation Coach** can:
- Review your work independently
- Provide consistent, coherent feedback
- Help you evaluate whether advisor's contradictions are substantive or careless
- Give you confidence about your work quality

**When to use**:
- After receiving contradictory feedback rounds
- When you can't tell if the problem is your work or advisor's inconsistency
- Before major revisions based on contradictory advice

**Cost**: $400-600 per chapter

**ROI**: Prevents wasting months on wrong revisions

#### **AI Tools for Consistency Checking**

**Thesify** or **Paperpal** can:
- Review same chapter multiple times with consistent standards
- Identify issues consistently
- Provide stable baseline for comparison

**How to use**:
1. Get AI feedback on original draft
2. Get advisor feedback
3. Compare: Does advisor's feedback align with clear issues AI identified?
4. If advisor feedback contradicts both AI and common sense, be cautious

**Cost**: $20-40/month

### For Students: When to Escalate

#### **Escalate if**:
- Contradictions are preventing progress
- You've sought clarification multiple times without resolution
- Advisor becomes defensive when contradictions are pointed out
- You're redoing the same work 3+ times due to changing feedback
- Other students have same problem with this advisor

#### **Escalation Path**:
1. **Document** everything thoroughly
2. **Direct conversation** with advisor first
3. **Director of Graduate Studies (DGS)** if no resolution
4. **Committee meeting** to get all members aligned
5. **Department Chair** if DGS doesn't help
6. **Consider advisor change** if pattern continues

## Solutions for Providing Consistent Feedback

### For Advisors: Preventing Inconsistencies

#### **Before Giving Feedback**

**✅ Review previous feedback**:
- Read what you said in last round
- Check proposal and earlier chapters
- Review notes from meetings

**✅ Read the whole document**:
- Don't comment chapter by chapter without seeing full picture
- Check page numbers and section lengths accurately
- Make sure you understand the argument

**✅ Check your assumptions**:
- Is this feedback based on careful reading or assumptions?
- Am I confusing this student's work with another's?
- Have I actually read the sections I'm commenting on?

#### **While Giving Feedback**

**✅ Use consistent language and standards**:
- If you say "too much X" somewhere, don't later say "needs more X"
- Apply same standards throughout document
- Be explicit about priorities

**✅ Acknowledge previous rounds**:
- "You've addressed my concerns about Y effectively"
- "This revision improves Z as I suggested"
- "This is much stronger than the last draft"

**✅ Explain if your thinking changed**:
- "I previously suggested X, but now I think Y would be better because..."
- "After reading the full chapter, I realize my earlier suggestion doesn't fit"

#### **After Giving Feedback**

**✅ Keep records**:
- Save copies of feedback you've provided
- Maintain notes on student's progress
- Review before next round

**✅ Be open to questions**:
- Invite student to ask for clarification
- Don't be defensive if they point out contradictions
- Acknowledge if you made an error

## Prevention Strategies

### Set Clear Expectations Early

**In Student-Advisor Agreement**:

```
FEEDBACK CONSISTENCY COMMITMENTS

Advisor commits to:
☐ Reviewing previous feedback before providing new feedback
☐ Reading entire chapters/sections before commenting
☐ Maintaining consistent standards across chapters
☐ Explaining if thinking/recommendations change
☐ Being open to clarification questions

Student commits to:
☐ Tracking feedback received and actions taken
☐ Providing revision memos showing what changed
☐ Seeking clarification when feedback seems contradictory
☐ Documenting conversations and agreements

Conflict Resolution:
If feedback seems inconsistent or contradictory, we agree to:
☐ Discuss via email or meeting
☐ Review previous feedback together
☐ Resolve contradiction before student proceeds
☐ Involve committee if needed
```

### Use Both Written and Verbal Feedback

**Research Finding**:
> "The ephemeral and generative nature of verbal feedback dialogues contrasts with concrete textual comments."

**Best Practice**:
- **Written feedback**: Creates record, reduces inconsistency
- **Verbal discussion**: Allows clarification, nuance
- **Follow-up summary**: Email after meeting summarizing agreements

**Template After Meeting**:
```
Subject: Summary of Today's Meeting

Dear Professor,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To make sure I understood correctly,
here's my understanding of what we agreed:

1. Keep thematic organization (not chronological)
2. Expand methods section by 5-7 pages
3. Cut literature review section 3.2 to 2-3 pages
4. Submit revised draft by [date]

Please let me know if I've misunderstood anything.

Best,
[Student]
```

**If advisor doesn't correct, you have written record.**

## Success Stories

### Student Who Navigated Contradictory Feedback

**Situation**:
- Advisor gave contradictory feedback on three consecutive drafts
- First said "add more theory," then "too theoretical," then "needs more theory"
- Student wasted 4 months

**Strategy**:
1. Created feedback tracking log showing contradictions
2. Requested meeting with advisor
3. Showed log diplomatically: "I want to make sure I understand..."
4. Hired GradCoach for independent review ($500)
5. Used GradCoach feedback as "second opinion"
6. Brought both to committee meeting

**Outcome**:
- Committee meeting revealed advisor wasn't reading carefully
- Committee agreed student's chapter was actually solid
- Secondary advisor took over primary feedback role
- Student graduated within semester

**Investment**: $500 for external review
**Savings**: Prevented another semester of revisions = $15,000+
