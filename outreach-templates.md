## 1. University Writing Center Directors

### Template 1A: Initial Outreach - Research Sharing

**Subject**: Research on dissertation feedback challenges - relevant to your students?

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], a PhD candidate at [University] researching dissertation
feedback challenges across graduate programs.

I recently completed an analysis of 500+ PhD student experiences and identified
6 major pain points related to advisor feedback (lack of feedback, vague
comments, slow turnaround, etc.). The data is pretty striking - 38% of students
report struggling to get any feedback at all.

I thought this might be relevant to the work you do with graduate students at
[University]. Would you be interested in seeing the research findings? I've
compiled them into a report that several writing centers have found useful for
understanding what students are struggling with.

[Specific personalization based on their writing center]:
I saw that [University] Writing Center offers [specific program they have -
dissertation support groups, consultations, etc.]. This research might provide
helpful context for those conversations.

Happy to share the report if useful - no strings attached. I'm also building a
tool based on this research to help students get better feedback, but wanted
to share the findings first since they stand on their own.

Best,
[Your Name]
PhD Candidate, [Field]
[University]
[Email]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Leads with value (research), not ask
- Positions you as peer researcher, not salesperson
- Shows you did homework about their center
- No hard ask in first email
- Opens door for conversation

---

### Template 1B: Second Email - Tool Introduction

**Send 3-5 days after they respond positively to Template 1A**

**Subject**: Re: Research on dissertation feedback - tool I'm building

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for your interest in the research! Attached is the full report on
dissertation feedback pain points.

[If they shared thoughts in their response, acknowledge them]:
You mentioned [specific thing they said] - that's exactly what I found in the
data as well. [2-3 sentences engaging with their comment].

---

I mentioned I'm building a tool based on this research. Here's what it does:

**PhD-Assist** helps students get structured, specific feedback on dissertation
work using validated rubrics. The goal is to supplement (not replace) advisor
and writing center support by:
- Identifying issues before students submit to advisors (reducing revision rounds)
- Providing interim feedback during long advisor wait times
- Using rubric-based frameworks that align with what committees actually evaluate

I'm currently running a beta program with 30 PhD students to test and refine it.

**Potential value for [University] students:**
- Free resource during beta period
- Complements your writing center consultations
- Helps students come to consultations with more specific questions
- Could reduce the "my advisor won't give me feedback" challenges you're seeing

**Would this be useful for your students?**

If so, I'd love to:
- Offer free beta access to [X] students from [University]
- Get your feedback on how to make it most useful for writing center context
- Share results/insights back with you

No pressure if it's not a fit. But thought I'd offer since you work with exactly
the population struggling with these issues.

Let me know if you'd like to discuss.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - If you know colleagues at other universities who work with graduate
writers, feel free to share the research report. The more this data gets out
there, the better.
```

**Why This Works**:
- Delivers promised value first (attached report)
- Engages with their response (shows you read it)
- Clear explanation of what tool does
- Frames as complementary to their work, not competitive
- Specific ask with clear value proposition
- Easy out if not interested

---

### Template 1C: Cold Email (If No Prior Contact)

**Subject**: [University] PhD students & dissertation feedback challenges

**Body**:
```
Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because of your work with graduate students at [University]
Writing Center.

I'm a PhD student researching dissertation feedback challenges, and just
completed an analysis of 500+ experiences. The findings are relevant to the
students you work with:

• 38% struggle to get feedback from advisors at all
• 24% receive feedback too vague to act on
• Median turnaround time: 4-6 weeks

I compiled the research into a report with practical strategies that several
writing centers have found useful. Would you like me to send it over?

[Specific tie to their work]:
I noticed [University] offers [specific program] - this data might provide
helpful context for those conversations with students.

Separately, I'm building a tool based on this research to help students get
structured feedback between advisor meetings. If your students might benefit,
I'm offering free beta access to a limited number of graduate writers.

Either way, happy to share the research. Let me know if useful.

Best,
[Your Name]
PhD Candidate, [Field], [University]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Short and scannable
- Clear value proposition
- Specific data points (credibility)
- Personalized to their institution
- Two options (research report OR beta access)
- Low commitment ask

- Keep momentum after boot camp ends (6 months free access)

**What I Need:**
- Feedback on how to make the tool most useful for boot camp context
- 5-10 participants willing to try it and share honest thoughts

**Logistics:**
- Free during 6-month beta period
- I'd provide brief training/overview (15 min at start of boot camp?)
- Minimal commitment from you - I handle onboarding/support

Would this be useful for your participants?

evaluate.

**Department Benefit:**

- I handle all onboarding, support, and feedback collection

Would this be valuable for [Department]'s PhD students?

If you'd like more information or to discuss, I'm happy to set up a brief call.

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅
- **Personalize every email** - reference specific programs, recent news, their work
- **Lead with value** - research, not tool
- **Be specific** - clear asks, clear benefits
- **Make it easy** - provide materials, minimal work for them
- **Follow up** - most partnerships come from follow-ups
- **Track everything** - learn what works
- **Be professional** - you're representing research
- **Be respectful** - their time is valuable

### Don'ts ❌
- **Mass BCC emails** - looks like spam
- **Generic templates** - "Dear Sir/Madam"
- **Pushy language** - respect their autonomy
- **Over-promise** - be realistic about benefits
- **Forget to follow up** - most won't respond to first email
- **Give up too soon** - persistence (respectful) pays off
- **Ignore responses** - reply within 24 hours
- **Make it about you** - focus on student benefit

---

## Success Stories to Reference

**As you get partnerships, add them to emails:**

```
"We're currently partnering with [University A] Graduate Writing Center and
[University B] Department of [X], with positive early feedback from students."
```

**As you get testimonials:**

```
"Recent feedback from beta testers:
'Finally, feedback that actually tells me what to fix' - Sarah, History PhD
'Cut our revision rounds in half' - James, Biology PhD"
```
