# Pain Point #1: Complete Absence of Feedback

## Overview

**The Problem**: Advisors who don't respond to emails, ignore draft submissions for months, or provide no feedback at all on student work.

**Severity**: **HIGHEST** - Career and financial consequences

**Prevalence**: Common complaint across all major graduate student forums (r/GradSchool, GradCafe, Academia Stack Exchange)

---

## The Problem in Detail

### What Students Experience

Students report advisors who:
- **Ignore emails for months** containing thesis drafts
- **Never respond** to draft submissions at all
- **Instruct students to submit** without providing any feedback on content
- **Avoid meetings** or cancel repeatedly
- **Provide no guidance** on whether work is acceptable

### Real User Stories

#### **Catherine's Story - Master's Student**

**What Happened**:
> Catherine's advisor instructed her to submit her thesis draft to the university without providing ANY feedback or guidance on the content. She assumed the submission instruction implied approval of the work's quality.

**The Consequence**:
> After submission, the advisor assigned a grade of 7 out of 10 and suggested Catherine transfer to another university—a grade that "effectively disqualified me from pursuing a PhD" at her institution and made it difficult to apply to other reputable universities.

**The Injustice**:
> Catherine notes that her peers under the same advisor "received sufficient guidance and support" while she did not, suggesting potential discriminatory treatment.

**University Response**:
> Initially, the university rejected her formal complaint and demanded she accept the grade. Only when Catherine threatened escalation to higher authorities did the institution rescind the grade—though without providing the requested new advisor assignment.

#### **GradCafe Forum User**

> "My advisor won't return my thesis edits. I've been sending chapters since spring break and have received only 10 pages of text edits total. I meet with them once or twice a month but get no substantial feedback."

**Source**: The GradCafe Forums

#### **Multiple Reports**

> "Some supervisors ignore emails for months, causing students to pay for extra semesters because work hasn't been reviewed."

> Students report receiving "no feedback on work, and often no reply at all."

- **Anger and frustration** - Unfairness of the situation
- **Self-doubt** - Wondering if the work is terrible
- **Isolation** - Feeling alone in the struggle

### Time Impact

- Students pay for extra semesters while waiting
- Months of limbo not knowing next steps
- Can't move forward with subsequent chapters
- Defense timeline completely disrupted

## What Good Feedback Looks Like (The Solution)

### Timeliness Standards

**Minimum Acceptable**:
- **Acknowledgment of receipt**: Within 2-3 days of submission
- **Timeline for feedback**: Communicated upfront (e.g., "I'll have comments in 3 weeks")
- **Actual feedback delivery**: 3-4 weeks maximum for chapter-length submissions

**Best Practice**:
> "Ideally, your supervisor will contact you within a few days to let you know they've received your draft and provide a timeline for when feedback will be ready."

**Institutional Requirements**:
- Princeton requires PhD students meet with advisors "in no case less than once per semester"
- **Recommended frequency**: Weekly or bi-weekly meetings during active writing

### Communication Standards

**What Students Need**:
1. **Acknowledgment**: "Got your draft, will review by [date]"
2. **Progress updates**: If timeline changes, communicate proactively
3. **Availability**: Clear office hours or communication windows
4. **Response time expectations**: Agreed-upon timeline (e.g., 48 hours for emails)

### Meeting Frequency Guidelines

**Recommended Schedule**:
- **Early stage (Year 1-2)**: Weekly or every 2 weeks
- **Mid-program**: Every 2-3 weeks
- **Writing stage**: Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins
- **Near completion**: More frequent as needed

**Rationale**:
> "This frequency gives enough time for students to accomplish something but not so much that they waste time or become frustrated going down a bad path."

## Practical Solutions

### Immediate Actions for Students

#### 1. **Establish Clear Expectations Upfront**

Use a **Student-Advisor Feedback Agreement**:

```
DISSERTATION FEEDBACK EXPECTATIONS AGREEMENT

Student: _______________
Advisor: _______________
Date: _______________

FEEDBACK TIMELINE
- Expected turnaround: _____ weeks for chapter-length submissions
- Acknowledgment of receipt within: _____ days
- Shorter pieces (<10 pages): _____ days

MEETING SCHEDULE
- Frequency: ☐ Weekly  ☐ Bi-weekly  ☐ Monthly
- Duration: _____ minutes/hours
- Format: ☐ In-person  ☐ Video  ☐ Phone

  ☐ Other: _____
```

#### 2. **Document Everything**

- **Keep email records** of all submissions
- **Note submission dates** and expected response dates
- **Track meeting attendance** (when scheduled, when actually met)
- **Save all communications** for potential escalation

#### 3. **Set Interim Deadlines**

When submitting work:
> "Hi Professor, I'm submitting Chapter 3 for your review. Based on our previous discussions, would you be able to provide feedback within 3 weeks? I'd like to discuss your comments in our meeting on [date]. Please let me know if this timeline works for you."

**Benefits**:
- Creates collaborative deadline
- Shows professionalism
- Easier to follow up if deadline passes

#### 4. **Follow Up Strategically**

**Timeline**:
- **Day 3-5**: Email to confirm receipt (if no acknowledgment)
- **Week 3**: Polite follow-up about timeline
- **Week 5**: More direct follow-up, copy DGS if appropriate
- **Week 6+**: Escalate to department leadership

**Sample Follow-Up Email**:
```
Subject: Following up: Chapter 3 submitted [Date]

Dear Professor [Name],

I wanted to follow up on Chapter 3, which I submitted on [date]. I know
you're very busy, and I wanted to check if you've had a chance to review
it. I'm eager to incorporate your feedback and move forward with the
next chapter.

Would it be helpful to schedule a brief meeting to discuss your initial
thoughts, even if you haven't had time for detailed comments?

I'm available [times]. Please let me know what works for you.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

#### 5. **Seek Alternative Feedback Sources**

- **AI tools**: Thesify, Paperpal ($200-400/year) for instant feedback

**Budget-Friendly Hybrid**:

### Escalation Path

If advisor remains unresponsive:

**Step 1: Direct Conversation**
- Request formal meeting to discuss communication expectations
- Express concern about timeline
- Ask about preferred communication method

**Step 2: Involve Director of Graduate Studies (DGS)**
- Explain situation professionally
- Show documentation of attempts to communicate
- Ask for guidance on next steps

**Step 3: Department Chair**
- If DGS doesn't resolve issue
- Request mediation or advisor change

**Step 4: Graduate School Dean's Office**
- Formal complaint if needed
- Ombudsperson if available
- Document everything

**Step 5: Consider Changing Advisors**
- Last resort but sometimes necessary
- Review department and graduate school guidelines
- Protect yourself legally and academically

- ⚠️ Takes >1 week to respond to emails
- ⚠️ Vague about when they'll provide feedback
- ⚠️ Never provides specific timelines
- ⚠️ Other students complain about same advisor
- ⚠️ Advisor has reputation for being "hands-off"

**If you see these signs**: Build your backup feedback network immediately
