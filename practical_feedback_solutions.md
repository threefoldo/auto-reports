**❌ Inappropriate AI Use**:
- Having AI write content for you
- Submitting AI-generated text as your own work
- Using AI to generate research findings

**Key Principle**: "AI should assist, not replace your academic work. They provide feedback, sources, or structure, not content."

**Equity Argument**: "AI copyediting is an efficient way to employ a sophisticated editing assistant without the financial price tag associated with hiring a human editor. Thus, using AI for copyediting also levels some of the privilege advantages that wealthier students have concerning hiring external assistance."

   - Workshops on academic writing

2. **Peer Writing Group**
   - Weekly or bi-weekly meetings
   - Reader perspective feedback
   - Accountability and motivation
   - Use platforms like PhinisheD for online support

**Technology Layer ($200-400/year)**:
3. **AI Tool Subscription** (Thesify or Paperpal)
   - Quick feedback on drafts
   - Language and clarity improvements
   - Structural analysis
   - Use before sending to advisor or professionals

**Professional Layer ($500-2,000/year)**:
4. **Strategic Professional Consultations**
   - Methodology review at proposal stage ($300-500)

   - Final pre-defense comprehensive review ($500-1,000)

### Best Practices for Hybrid Approach

#### **1. Use Each Source for Its Strengths**

| Source | Best Use | Don't Use For |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **AI Tools** | Quick structure check, language polish, identifying patterns | Research quality judgment, field-specific feedback |
| **Peers** | Reader perspective, clarity, catching errors | Methodology assessment, contribution evaluation |
| **Writing Center** | Writing process, academic conventions, organization | Field-specific content, research design |
| **Professionals** | Research quality, methodology, field contribution | Basic grammar (waste of money) |
| **Advisor** | Research direction, field significance, committee management | Motivation, detailed editing |

#### **2. Sequence Feedback Strategically**

**Wrong Approach**: Send rough draft to expensive professional editor
**Right Approach**: Self-edit → AI → Peer → Writing center → Professional

**Rationale**: Each layer improves the draft, so professional focuses on high-level issues

#### **3. Time Your Professional Consultations**

**Critical Milestones for Professional Feedback**:
1. **Proposal stage**: Methodology review
2. **Mid-point**: Structure and coherence check
3. **Complete draft**: Comprehensive review
4. **Post-defense revisions** (if needed): Final polish

**Don't Waste Professional Fees On**:
- Early exploratory drafts
- Grammar and formatting (use AI)
- Questions your advisor can answer

#### **4. Build Your Feedback Network Early**

**Month 1 of Dissertation**:
- ✅ Set up writing center appointments
- ✅ Join or form peer writing group
- ✅ Subscribe to AI tool
- ✅ Research professional services for future use
- ✅ Create feedback agreement with advisor

**Don't Wait Until Crisis Mode**

### Customizing Your Hybrid Approach

#### **If You Have a Supportive Advisor**:
- Reduce professional consultations (save for 1-2 critical reviews)
- Increase peer review and writing center use
- Use AI for interim feedback between advisor meetings

#### **If Your Advisor is Unavailable**:
- Increase professional consultations (quarterly check-ins)
- Consider dissertation coach for ongoing guidance
- Leverage writing center extensively

#### **If You're on Tight Budget**:
- Maximize free resources (writing center, peers)
- Use AI tool free trials strategically
- Save for ONE critical professional review at end

#### **If You're Time-Pressured**:
- Invest more in professional rapid-turnaround services
- Use AI for quick daily feedback
- Parallel process (work on next section while waiting for feedback)
