Question: What is process mining and why is it important?

Answer: Process mining is a family of data-driven techniques used to analyze business processes using event data extracted from information systems like Enterprise Resource Planning programs (ERPs) and Customer Relationship Management systems (CRMs). It allows business users to identify bottlenecks, rework, deviations, and sources of waste in their processes, and to discover opportunities to optimize performance and maximize positive business outcomes.

Process mining is important because it provides a digital footprint of processes and a companyâ€™s real workflow, offering a clear view of how a business actually functions. It can identify every variation in process and bottleneck, uncovering blind spots. It is purely data-driven, with no agenda or biases, making it a reliable tool for business process management. It can help businesses improve their results, revenues, and profitability by mapping onto target KPIs or key performance indicators. It also plays a crucial role in facilitating data-driven decision-making processes, empowering business process automation, and identifying and addressing process bottlenecks.

1. Vodafone: By using process mining, Vodafone discovered that they had low automated transactions and decided to focus on this area. As a result, they started using robotic process automation (RPA) to improve their order process, which decreased their unit process order costs from $3.22 to $2.85.

2. BridgeLoan: This company integrated a process mining tool into its ERP system to identify bottlenecks in their loan application processes. After recreating their processes, the process started to progress 40% faster and the company can now process 30,000 applications in a month.

3. AB InBev: This food and drink company used the QPR process mining tool to reduce operational costs and gain better visibility of actual performance in their supply chain.

4. Afrisam: This construction and materials company used the QPR process mining tool to improve overall process efficiency and better visualize risks in their risk management process.

5. Akzonobel: This chemicals company used the Celonis process mining tool to identify that 18% of processes have manual changes, improve SRM efficiency from 40% to 70% in one year, and reduce costs in their Purchase-to-Pay, Accounts Payable, and Order-to-Cash processes.

6. Alexianer: This healthcare company used the Lana Labs process mining tool to optimize patient care quality, reduce waiting times by 80%, and improve communication across functions in their emergency hospitalization process.

These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of process mining tools in various industries and processes.

Question: What are expert opinions on the future of process mining?

Answer: Experts predict several trends for the future of process mining. These include:

1. Integration with other platforms: Wil van der Aalst, a key figure in the academic foundations of process mining, observes a shift towards more integrated tools and capabilities in the process mining market. This is evident in tech giants acquiring process mining solutions and vendors merging process mining with different platforms, specifically automation platforms.

2. Process mining as an automation enabler: Process mining is expected to play a crucial role in process automation efforts. It allows companies to analyze and visualize processes, helping to discover areas to implement process automation. By 2022, businesses are expected to focus their use of process mining to drive digital transformation.

3. Process mining overtaking the BPM market: The interest in process mining and related terms has been increasing since 2015. Process mining is seen as a bridge between data science and process science, enabling enterprises to fully understand how their core business processes run and find hidden value opportunities.

4. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Integration: Process mining will increasingly benefit from the integration of AI and machine learning techniques. These advancements will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of process discovery, anomaly detection, and prediction.

5. Real-time Process Monitoring: The future will see an emphasis on real-time process monitoring, enabling organizations to proactively detect anomalies, prevent bottlenecks, and respond swiftly to changing business conditions.

6. Advanced Visualization and Interaction Techniques: Improved visualization techniques will allow stakeholders to interact more intuitively with process mining results.

7. Cross-Organizational Process Mining: As collaboration and integration between organizations become more prevalent, cross-organizational process mining will emerge as a critical area.

8. Utilization of AI: The utilization of AI is expected to transform process mining, especially in terms of user interface and actionability.
