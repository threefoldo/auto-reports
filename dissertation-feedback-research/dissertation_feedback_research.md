# Dissertation Feedback Pain Points: User Stories & Market Research

## Executive Summary

Graduate students across all disciplines face significant frustrations with dissertation advisor feedback. The most common complaint is not receiving meaningful, timely, or actionable feedback—with some students describing advisors who ignore emails for months, provide only surface-level comments, or give contradictory guidance. This research identifies specific pain points, real user stories, and strategies to reach these students.

## Key Pain Points Worth Solving

### 1. **Complete Absence of Feedback**
- **Problem**: Advisors ignore emails for months, don't respond to draft submissions
- **Impact**: Students pay for extra semesters while waiting for review
- **Severity**: HIGH - Career and financial consequences

**User Story - Catherine (Master's Student)**:
> Catherine's advisor instructed her to submit her thesis without providing ANY feedback on content. She assumed submission implied approval. The advisor then gave her a 7/10 grade that "effectively disqualified me from pursuing a PhD" and suggested she transfer to another university. When she complained, the university initially rejected her complaint until she threatened escalation.

**User Story - GradCafe Forum**:
> "My advisor won't return my thesis edits. I've been sending chapters since spring break and have received only 10 pages of text edits total. I meet with them once or twice a month but get no substantial feedback."

### 2. **Vague, Non-Actionable Feedback**
- **Problem**: Cryptic comments without explaining how to improve
- **Impact**: Students experience "meltdowns," spend months in confusion, spiral into self-doubt
- **Severity**: HIGH - Mental health and productivity

**User Story - Design Research PhD (Year 1)**:
> "During our monthly meetings, my supervisor offers no advice or guidance about how to develop research ideas into research questions. When I ask directly 'what topic do you think has the most value?' they respond with 'what topic do YOU think has the most value?' I'm nearing the end of year one without clear direction."

**Common Complaints**:
- "Only gives me feedback on grammar and expression" (not research quality)
- Feedback identifies problems but fails to suggest solutions
- Deletes substantial work without explanation

### 3. **Inconsistent/Contradictory Feedback**
- **Problem**: Advisors contradict themselves or appear not to have read the work
- **Impact**: Students don't know which direction to take, waste time on wrong revisions
- **Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Time waste and confusion

**User Story - PhD Student**:
> "My advisor criticized that 'one-hundred pages should not be spent on a particular topic' when that subject only occupied thirty pages. He expressed concern about the overall trajectory, showing he either didn't read or doesn't remember my fellowship applications, previous writing, or our conversations. He criticized aspects universally praised by my fellowship mentors. When questioned, he retracted much of his criticism."

**Quote**:
> "Every PhD guide tells students to do whatever their advisor wants in order to graduate. I'm happy to oblige, but what do you do if your advisor's comments make no sense?"

### 4. **Slow Turnaround Times**
- **Problem**: Takes weeks or months to get feedback
- **Impact**: Delays graduation, increases costs, causes anxiety
- **Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Financial and timeline impact

**Reported**: "Takes three weeks to provide feedback" is common; some wait months

### 5. **Harsh/Demoralizing Feedback Without Positive Reinforcement**
- **Problem**: Harsh style with no positive feedback
- **Impact**: Students feel demoralized, unmotivated, develop mental blocks
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Mental health impact

**User Story - Multiple Students**:
> "My advisor's style is quite harsh and they never explicitly give positive feedback. It's hard to feel motivated to continue working on my dissertation after every meeting."

**Research Finding**:
> "Many PhD students experience mental or emotional blocks about feedback, finding it hard to open feedback emails. One student took an average of three days to open a feedback email, and a further day or two to read all comments."

### 6. **Advisors Who Are Overextended/Not Engaged**
- **Problem**: Advisors with no time, too many projects, or not actively researching
- **Impact**: Students get minimal attention, can't attach to research projects
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Limits research quality

**User Story - 7th Year PhD**:
> "Despite having over 20 publications and winning multiple national awards amounting to around $44K in funding, my advisor still prevents me from graduating."

## Emotional & Psychological Impact

### Anxiety and Stress
- Students report it takes **3+ days** to work up courage to open feedback emails
- Many feel "unsettled or ill" when receiving feedback
- "Few things are more agonizing than a thorough dressing down of your work"

### Isolation and Self-Doubt
- Students think they're alone in struggling when it's actually very common
- Vague feedback causes students to "spiral into self-doubt"
- Some students "get overwhelmed and stop" working entirely

### Financial Consequences
- Paying for extra semesters while waiting for advisor response
- Career delays and lost opportunities
- Inability to pursue PhD or further education

## What Students Actually Need (The Gap)

Based on the research, students need:

1. **Timely feedback** - Responses within days, not weeks or months
2. **Specific, actionable comments** - Not just "this needs work" but "here's how to improve it"
3. **Feedback on substance, not just grammar** - Analysis of research quality, methodology, arguments
4. **Consistency** - Coherent guidance that doesn't contradict itself
5. **Balance of criticism and encouragement** - Recognition of what's working
6. **Clear expectations** - Understanding what "good enough" looks like
7. **Availability and responsiveness** - Regular communication

**Quote from Student**:
> "I need feedback on whether my research design and methodology meet program standards, not just corrections on writing mechanics."
