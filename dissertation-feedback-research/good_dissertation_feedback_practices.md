# What Makes Good and Useful Feedback for PhD Students

## Executive Summary

Based on academic research, advisor guidelines, and student perspectives, effective dissertation feedback has seven core characteristics: it is **specific and actionable**, **timely**, **focused on substance over mechanics**, **balanced between encouragement and critique**, **developmental/formative**, **dialogic** (combining written and verbal communication), and **appropriately scaffolded** to promote independence. This report synthesizes best practices, research findings, and concrete examples to define what constitutes truly helpful dissertation feedback.

## Core Characteristics of Effective Dissertation Feedback

### 1. Specific and Actionable (Not Vague)

**Definition**: Good feedback tells students exactly what needs to change and why, with concrete suggestions for improvement.

**Research Finding**:
> "The most useful feedback is almost always feedback that is specific. Specific feedback gives you something to go on - you know what's at issue and can either reject it or deal with it."

> "The best way to identify constructive feedback is to look for actionable points - if supervisors only comment on quality without making suggestions for changes, that's not constructive criticism."

**Examples of Vague vs. Specific Feedback**:

| ❌ Vague (Unhelpful) | ✅ Specific (Helpful) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "This is such a great paper" | "The anecdote you used at the start was a really effective way to communicate the context" |
| "I really didn't quite get what you were trying to say" | "I got lost because the headings didn't help me track the argument" |
| "Your argument doesn't work for me" | "Your argument doesn't work because you haven't yet taken counter views into account" |
| "The ending of the paper was weak" | "The ending needed a discussion of study implications" |
| "This example didn't work for me" | "This example confuses the timeline - consider using the Johnson (2015) case instead" |
| "This needs work" | "Your methods section needs more detail about how you selected participants - include your sampling criteria and justification" |

**Key Practice**: Specific feedback should tell writers **what** needs changing, **why** it's problematic, and **how** to improve it.

---

### 2. Timely and Responsive

**Definition**: Feedback arrives quickly enough to be useful and doesn't leave students waiting in limbo.

**Recommended Timeframes**:
- **Ideal**: Acknowledgment within a few days of submission
- **Standard turnaround**: 3-4 weeks for substantial chapter feedback
- **Acceptable range**: 2 weeks to 1 month, depending on length and complexity
- **Unacceptable**: Months of silence (causes financial and timeline damage)

**Best Practice from Research**:
> "Ideally, your supervisor will contact you within a few days to let you know they've received your draft" and provide a timeline for when feedback will be ready.

**Why Timing Matters**:
- Students maintain momentum and don't lose context
- Prevents paying for extra semesters due to delays
- Reduces anxiety and uncertainty
- Allows students to plan next steps

**Recommendation**: Establish clear turnaround expectations upfront - "Ask each committee member clearly at the start of the process as to how much feedback they will be able and willing to provide."

---

### 3. Focused on Substance Over Mechanics

**Definition**: Prioritizes research quality, methodology, argumentation, and logic over grammar and formatting.

**Research Finding**:
> "Advisors should spend their feedback time on things that require their expertise: the subject matter, research methods, and the student's research in their field."

> "Poor feedback focuses on grammar and other formal elements when basic conceptual and content issues are obviously flawed, as grammar and formal elements should not be a professor's main concern."

**What Students Need**:
> "I need feedback on whether my research design and methodology meet program standards, not just corrections on writing mechanics."

**Hierarchy of Feedback Focus**:

**Higher-Order Concerns (Priority)**:
1. Research design and methodology
2. Theoretical framework
3. Argument logic and coherence
4. Evidence quality and appropriateness
5. Contribution to field
6. Organization and structure
7. Literature review completeness

**Lower-Order Concerns (Secondary)**:
1. Writing clarity and style
2. Grammar and punctuation
3. Citation formatting
4. Layout and formatting

**Best Practice**: Address higher-order concerns first. Only focus on lower-order concerns once the substantive issues are resolved, or mention that editing will be needed after revisions.

---

### 4. Balanced Between Encouragement and Critique

**Definition**: Recognizes strengths while identifying areas for improvement; maintains motivation while being honest.

**Research Finding**:
> "Feedback is most effective when it is timely, perceived as relevant, meaningful and **encouraging**, and offers suggestions for improvement that are within a student's understanding."

> "Intention to use ratings were higher for comments which were 'nice' (supportive, encouraging, motivating, positive in tone) and 'usable' (clear, constructive, helpful)."

**Why Balance Matters**:
- Students can experience emotional blocks and anxiety about feedback
- Purely critical feedback can be demoralizing and demotivating
- Recognition of strengths helps students understand what's working
- Encouragement maintains momentum during the long dissertation process

**The Feedback Sandwich Debate**:

While the classic "feedback sandwich" (positive-negative-positive) can feel insincere if forced, research shows that **genuinely identifying strengths alongside areas for improvement is valuable**.

**Better Approach**: Honest, specific praise combined with honest, specific critique
- ✅ "Your methods section was succinct but gave me all the detail needed to trust your account"
- ✅ "The theoretical framework here is strong and well-justified"
- ✅ "This argument is compelling - now strengthen it by addressing the counterargument from Smith (2018)"

**Growth Mindset Feedback**:

Based on Carol Dweck's research, **praise effort and strategies, not innate ability**:

| ❌ Fixed Mindset Praise | ✅ Growth Mindset Praise |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| "You're so smart!" | "Your systematic approach to the literature review really paid off" |
| "You're a natural researcher" | "The effort you put into refining your methodology shows in the clarity of your results" |
| "This is brilliant work" | "The way you synthesized these three theoretical perspectives demonstrates strong analytical thinking" |

**Research Finding**: Students praised for effort did 30% better on subsequent tasks, while those praised for intelligence did 20% worse after encountering challenges.

---

### 5. Developmental and Formative (Not Just Summative)

**Definition**: Ongoing feedback throughout the process that helps students learn and improve, rather than just evaluation at the end.

**Formative vs. Summative Feedback**:

| **Formative Feedback** | **Summative Feedback** |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Ongoing throughout process | At end of process |
| Focuses on improvement | Focuses on evaluation |
| Low-stakes or ungraded | High-stakes, tied to grades |
| "Here's how to strengthen this" | "This meets/doesn't meet standards" |
| Promotes learning | Measures learning |
| Iterative and responsive | Final judgment |

**Research Finding**:
> "Formative feedback is ongoing and helps faculty to focus on student learning and students to better understand the limits of their own knowledge and how to improve."

> "Formative feedback can increase student motivation and self-directed learning and help them to become self-directed learners."

**Best Practice for Dissertations**:
- Provide feedback on **sections** and **chapters** as they develop (formative)
- Use formative feedback to guide the student's learning process
- Reserve summative evaluation for defense or final submission
- Create opportunities for revision based on feedback

**Why This Matters**: Dissertations are learning documents. Students need guidance during the writing process, not just judgment at the end.

---

### 6. Dialogic (Combining Written and Verbal Feedback)

**Definition**: Uses both written comments and face-to-face discussion to create genuine dialogue about the work.

**Research Finding**:
> "Students respond more positively to verbal feedback, perceiving it as closer to dialogue and a better natural dialogue than written feedback."

> "Research indicates it is valuable for supervisors to provide both written and verbal feedback on writing. Supervisors frequently use meetings with students to check their understanding and clarify the feedback that had been given on draft texts, to encourage the student, and to point the way forward."

> "The ephemeral and generative nature of verbal feedback dialogues contrasts with concrete textual comments."

**Recommended Approach**:

**Written Feedback**:
- Provides concrete, reviewable record
- Allows for detailed marginal comments
- Students can reference repeatedly
- Good for specific technical corrections
- Can be overwhelming if not balanced with dialogue

**Verbal Feedback**:
- Allows for clarification and questions
- More encouraging and motivating
- Enables real-time discussion
- Helps check student understanding
- More natural for big-picture guidance

**Best Practice**:
1. Provide written feedback on drafts
2. Schedule meeting to discuss feedback
3. Use meeting to:
   - Clarify written comments
   - Discuss big-picture issues
   - Encourage the student
   - Plan next steps
   - Check understanding

**Meeting Frequency Guidelines**:

**Institutional Minimum**: At least once per semester (Princeton requirement)

**Recommended Frequency**:
- **Early stage**: Weekly or every 2 weeks
- **Mid-program**: Every 2-3 weeks
- **Writing stage**: Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins
- **Near completion**: More frequent as needed

**Rationale**:
> "This frequency gives enough time for students to accomplish something but not so much that they waste time or become frustrated going down a bad path."

---

### 7. Appropriately Scaffolded (Promoting Independence)

**Definition**: Feedback that provides structured support early on but gradually removes scaffolding to develop student independence and critical thinking.

**Research Finding**:
> "The analyses present feedback as an apprenticeship: a multi-dimensional scaffolding and an interconnected mentorship oriented towards the process of learning and the nurturing of a writerly self."

> "Supervisors deliberately promoted independence through feedback as the candidature progressed, and candidates identified removal of scaffolding as helpful for the development of critical thinking and writing or independence."

**Scaffolding Approach by Stage**:

| **Stage** | **Feedback Approach** | **Example** |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Early (Year 1-2)** | Directive, detailed guidance | "Structure your literature review using these four themes..." |
| **Middle (Year 2-3)** | Questioning, suggesting options | "Have you considered organizing around X or Y?" |
| **Late (Year 3+)** | Reflective, minimal intervention | "What are your thoughts on the structure?" |

**Key Principle**: Good feedback helps students develop as independent scholars who can eventually self-evaluate their work.

**Balance**: Provide enough support that students don't flounder, but not so much that they become dependent.

## Types of Useful Feedback Comments

### Marginal Comments (Line-by-Line)

**Best Practices**:
- Write in complete sentences when possible
- Be specific rather than generic
- Point forward to improvement, not just backward to problems
- Ask questions that promote analytical thinking

**Examples of Good Marginal Comments**:

**On Evidence**:
> "Your evidence in this paragraph is effective -- it convinces me to believe your claims."

**On Clarity**:
> "This sentence is unclear - are you arguing that X causes Y, or that they're correlated?"

**On Logic**:
> "This conclusion doesn't follow from your evidence. You've shown X and Y, but you're claiming Z. Can you add the missing link?"

**On Structure**:
> "Consider moving this paragraph earlier - it provides context needed to understand the argument that follows."

**On Literature**:
> "Have you looked at Johnson (2020)? Her work on X directly relates to your argument here."

**On Methods**:
> "Why did you choose this sampling method? Add 2-3 sentences justifying this choice over alternatives."

**Questioning Approach**:
> "Asking questions in margins promotes a useful analytical technique while helping students anticipate future readers' queries."

---

### Summary/End Comments (Overall Feedback)

**Best Practices**:
- Start with strengths and overall assessment
- Identify 2-3 major patterns to address
- Provide clear guidance on priorities for revision
- End with encouragement and next steps

**Example Structure**:

```
OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
This chapter makes a strong contribution by [specific strength]. Your
analysis of X is particularly compelling, and the connection you draw
between Y and Z is original.

MAJOR ISSUES TO ADDRESS:
1. Literature Review: Expand your engagement with the recent work on
   [topic], especially Smith (2021) and Chen (2022), which challenge
   some of your assumptions.

2. Methodology: Your sampling approach needs more justification. Why
   purposive sampling over random sampling? Address this in 1-2 paragraphs.

3. Results Organization: Consider reorganizing around themes rather than
   chronologically - it will strengthen your argument.

NEXT STEPS:
Focus first on #2 (methodology justification), as this affects how
readers evaluate your results. Then tackle the literature additions.
The reorganization can come last.

Let's meet next Tuesday to discuss your revision plan. You're making
solid progress - this chapter is taking good shape.
```

### Focus Areas for Different Dissertation Stages

**Proposal Stage**:
- Research questions: Clear? Answerable? Significant?
- Literature review: Comprehensive? Identifies gap?
- Methodology: Appropriate? Feasible? Ethical?
- Feasibility: Can this be completed in your timeframe?

**Data Collection/Analysis Stage**:
- Are methods being followed as proposed?
- Is data quality adequate?
- Are you seeing patterns worth exploring?
- Do you need to adjust approach?

**Writing Stage - Individual Chapters**:
- Does chapter address research questions?
- Is argument logical and well-supported?
- Is organization effective?
- Does it connect to other chapters?

**Complete Draft Stage**:
- Overall coherence and flow
- Contribution to field
- Dissertation-level argument (not just chapter-level)
- Preparing for defense

## What Students Should Be Able to Do After Good Feedback

After receiving effective feedback, students should be able to:

1. **Understand what's working**: Identify the strengths to maintain
2. **Identify specific problems**: Know exactly what needs to change
3. **Have a revision plan**: Understand the steps to improve the work
4. **Prioritize revisions**: Know what to tackle first vs. later
5. **Feel motivated**: Maintain momentum despite critique
6. **Develop skills**: Learn approaches applicable to future writing
7. **Anticipate reader questions**: Think more critically about their work

**The "Aha Moment" Test**:
> "You should be able to read the feedback and have an 'aha' moment about how to improve your dissertation."

If students finish reading feedback and still don't know what to do, the feedback has failed.

## Setting Clear Expectations (Student-Advisor Agreement)

### What to Discuss Upfront

**1. Communication Preferences**:
- Preferred method: Email? In-person? Both?
- Response time expectations
- How to handle urgent questions

**2. Meeting Schedule**:
- Frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
- Duration (30 minutes, 1 hour)
- Format (formal presentations vs. informal check-ins)

**3. Feedback Process**:
- Turnaround time for feedback (e.g., 3 weeks)
- Preferred format (track changes, comments, clean document + memo)
- How much feedback on early drafts vs. polished drafts
- Whether advisor provides line-by-line editing or big-picture only

**4. Submission Process**:
- What format to submit (Word, PDF, Google Doc)
- How much work to submit at once (full chapters, sections, complete draft)
- How to flag specific areas needing attention

**5. Roles and Responsibilities**:
- What students are responsible for (e.g., self-editing before submission)
- What advisor will focus on (content, structure, specific expertise)
- What committee members will provide

**Sample Agreement Template**:

```
FEEDBACK EXPECTATIONS AGREEMENT

Submission Format: Word document with line numbers
Submission Frequency: One chapter every 3-4 weeks
Feedback Turnaround: 3 weeks from submission
Feedback Format: Track changes + summary memo
Meeting Schedule: Every 2 weeks, 1 hour
Focus Areas: Research design, argumentation, field contribution
Student Responsibilities: Self-edit for clarity before submission
Additional Support: Writing center for grammar/style
```

## The SMART Feedback Framework

Good feedback should be:

- **S - Specific**: Not vague generalities, but concrete details
- **M - Meaningful**: Focused on what matters (substance over mechanics)
- **A - Actionable**: Clear steps for improvement
- **R - Realistic**: Doable within student's capacity and timeline
- **T - Timely**: Delivered when it can still be used

**Using SMART to Evaluate Feedback**:

| Question | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Is it Specific? | Does it tell me exactly what to change? |
| Is it Meaningful? | Does it focus on important issues vs. trivial ones? |
| Is it Actionable? | Do I know what steps to take? |
| Is it Realistic? | Can I accomplish this with my skills/time? |
| Is it Timely? | Can I still use this feedback productively? |

## Common Feedback Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Appropriating Student Voice**

**Problem**: Rewriting student's work in advisor's style rather than helping student improve their own voice.

**Research Finding**: Students value feedback that is "non-appropriative."

**What to do instead**: Suggest improvements while preserving student's scholarly voice.

### 2. **Inconsistent or Contradictory Comments**

**Problem**: Saying X in one place and not-X in another; giving feedback that shows you didn't read carefully.

**Example**: Criticizing 100 pages on a topic that only occupied 30 pages.

**What to do instead**: Read carefully before commenting; ensure comments are coherent.

### 3. **Grammar-Only Feedback on Flawed Drafts**

**Problem**: Correcting commas when the entire argument needs restructuring.

**What to do instead**: Address higher-order concerns first; note that editing will be needed later.

### 4. **Overwhelming Volume Without Priorities**

**Problem**: Providing 100+ comments with no indication of what's most important.

**What to do instead**:
- Flag top 2-3 patterns to address
- Use summary comments to set priorities
- Consider whether the draft was ready for detailed feedback

### 5. **Lack of Message Clarity**

**Problem**: Comments that are ambiguous or could be interpreted multiple ways.

**Research Finding**: "Feedback has drawbacks if it does not provide specific advice to guide improvement and lacks message clarity, which may result in a student's misinterpretation or inability to interpret."

**What to do instead**: Write clear, unambiguous comments; check understanding in follow-up meeting.

### 6. **Purely Evaluative (No Guidance)**

**Problem**: "This is weak," "This doesn't work," "Needs improvement" without explaining how.

**What to do instead**: Every criticism should include guidance for improvement.

### 7. **No Recognition of Strengths**

**Problem**: Only pointing out what's wrong, never what's right.

**Impact**: Students don't know what to preserve and may become demoralized.

**What to do instead**: Explicitly identify strengths and effective strategies.

---

## Student Responsibilities in the Feedback Process

Effective feedback is a two-way street. Students also have responsibilities:

### 1. **Request Specific Feedback**

Don't just say "please review." Instead:
- "Please focus on whether my methodology is sound"
- "I'm uncertain about the organization - does it flow logically?"
- "Does my literature review adequately cover the key debates?"
- "Am I addressing the research questions effectively?"

**Research Finding**:
> "Students should be directive about what kind of feedback they need, suggesting supervisors focus on specific aspects like text coherence, whether it addresses research questions, or whether they've read the right sources."

### 2. **Submit Work Ready for Feedback**

- Self-edit before submission
- Follow formatting guidelines
- Include line numbers for easy reference
- Flag areas of particular concern

### 3. **Respond to Feedback Substantively**

**Research Finding**:
> "Students must respond to feedback clearly in subsequent drafts - they don't have to change things exactly as suggested, but should at minimum explain why they disagree with proposed changes."

Options for responding:
- **Implement**: Make the suggested change
- **Modify**: Adapt the suggestion to better fit your approach
- **Explain**: Articulate why you're keeping it as is

### 4. **Follow Up for Clarification**

If feedback is unclear:
- Ask questions during follow-up meetings
- Request examples
- Discuss your interpretation to ensure understanding

### 5. **Maintain Momentum**

While waiting for feedback:
- Work on other chapters
- Conduct additional analysis
- Refine literature review
- Don't let the entire project stall

**Recommended Timeline**:
> "Plan for approximately one month between submission and receiving all committee feedback. This prevents delays from stalling your entire project."

---

## Examples of Complete Feedback Scenarios

### Example 1: Methods Chapter Feedback

**Student Submits**: Draft methods chapter

**Good Feedback Includes**:

**Marginal Comments**:
```
Line 47: "Good justification for qualitative approach here - the
exploratory nature of your RQ makes this appropriate."

Line 89: "Your sampling criteria are clear, but add 2-3 sentences
about WHY you chose these criteria. What theoretical or practical
reasons drove this choice?"

Line 156: "This data analysis procedure is unclear. Are you using
thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) or grounded theory (Charmaz,
2014)? Be explicit and cite appropriately."

Line 203: "Consider adding a positionality statement - how does your
background as a teacher influence your interpretation of classroom
data?"
```

**Summary Comment**:
```
STRENGTHS:
- Clear articulation of research design rationale
- Good alignment between RQs and methods
- Ethical considerations are thorough

REVISIONS NEEDED:
1. Data analysis: Be more explicit about your analytic approach (lines
   156-180). Name the specific method and cite key sources.

2. Positionality: Add a brief section on your background and how it
   shapes your interpretation (150-200 words).

3. Rigor: Expand discussion of trustworthiness - how will you ensure
   credibility, transferability, dependability? (Add 1 paragraph)

NEXT STEPS:
Revise focusing on #1 and #2 first. Send me just those sections within
2 weeks so we can make sure we're on the right track before you finalize
the whole chapter.

Let's meet Thursday to discuss your analytic approach in detail.
```

**Follow-Up Meeting**:
- Discuss different analytic approaches and which fits best
- Clarify expectations for positionality statement
- Answer student questions
- Encourage progress

---

### Example 2: Literature Review Feedback

**Student Submits**: Draft literature review chapter

**Good Feedback Includes**:

**Marginal Comments**:
```
Line 23: "Excellent framing of the key debates - this paragraph clearly
sets up the three major theoretical perspectives."

Line 67: "You're missing the recent critiques of this theory. See
Williams (2021) and Thompson (2022) - both challenge the assumptions
you're presenting as settled."

Line 134: "This section on measurement is thorough but feels tangential
to your main argument. Consider moving to an appendix or cutting to
2-3 sentences."

Line 201: "Strong synthesis here - you're not just summarizing but
showing how these theories relate. This is what literature reviews
should do."

Line 289: "Your 'gap in the literature' argument is weak here. The
gap isn't that no one has studied X, but that no one has studied X
in context Y using lens Z. Sharpen this."
```

**Summary Comment**:
```
This is a solid draft with strong organization and generally good
coverage. Your synthesis abilities are developing well - you're moving
beyond summary to analysis.

MAJOR REVISIONS:
1. Gap Argument (Lines 285-295): This is the most critical issue. Your
   gap needs to be more specific and defensible. You're not just finding
   something unstudied, but identifying a genuine need. Let's discuss
   this in our meeting.

2. Recent Literature (Throughout): You need to incorporate 2021-2023
   work. I've flagged key citations in comments. The field has moved
   forward on X and Y - your review needs to reflect this.

MINOR REVISIONS:
3. Section 3.2: Trim by about 30% - it's thorough but slowing your
   argument's momentum.

4. Transitions: Some section transitions are abrupt. Add 1-2 sentences
   at section breaks to show how ideas connect.

PRIORITIES:
Work on #1 (gap argument) first - this is foundational. Then update
citations (#2). Save trimming and transitions for last.

Timeline: Plan for 2-3 weeks of revision. Send me just the revised gap
section next week for a quick check before you overhaul the whole chapter.

Strong work - this chapter is taking shape well.
```

## Key Takeaways for Providing Good Feedback

### The "Golden Rules"

1. **Be Specific**: Vague feedback is useless feedback
2. **Focus on What Matters**: Substance before mechanics
3. **Provide Solutions, Not Just Problems**: Show the path forward
4. **Balance Critique and Encouragement**: Recognize strengths
5. **Be Timely**: Feedback delayed is feedback diminished
6. **Combine Written and Verbal**: Use both modes strategically
7. **Promote Independence**: Scaffold, then remove scaffolding
8. **Set Clear Expectations**: Agree on process upfront
9. **Check Understanding**: Use dialogue to clarify
10. **Remember the Goal**: Developing an independent scholar

### The Student Perspective Test

Ask yourself: After reading my feedback, will the student be able to:
- ✅ Identify what's working?
- ✅ Understand what needs to change?
- ✅ Know HOW to make improvements?
- ✅ Prioritize their revision efforts?
- ✅ Feel motivated to continue?

If the answer to any of these is "no," revise your feedback approach.
